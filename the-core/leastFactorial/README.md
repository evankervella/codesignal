Given an integer `n`, find the minimal `k` such that

    * `k = m!` (where `m! = 1 * 2 * ... * m`) for some integer `m`;
    * `k >= n`.

In other words, find the smallest factorial which is not less than `n`.

**Example**

For `n = 17`, the output should be `leastFactorial(n) = 24`.

`17 < 24 = 4! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4`, while `3! = 1 * 2 * 3 = 6 < 17`).
