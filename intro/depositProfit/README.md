You have deposited a specific amount of money into your bank account. Each year your balance increases at the same growth `rate`. With the assumption that you don't make any additional deposits, find out how long it would take for your balance to pass a specific `threshold`.

**Example**

* For `deposit = 100`, `rate = 20`, and `threshold = 170`, the output should be
`depositProfit(deposit, rate, threshold) = 3`.

Each year the amount of money in your account increases by `20%`. So throughout the years, your balance would be:

    * year 0: `100`;
    * year 1: `120`;
    * year 2: `144`;
    * year 3: `172.8`.

Thus, it will take `3` years for your balance to pass the `threshold`, so the answer is `3`.
