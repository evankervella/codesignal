Caring for a plant can be hard work, but since you tend to it regularly, you have a plant that grows consistently. Each day, its height increases by a fixed amount represented by the integer `upSpeed`. But due to lack of sunlight, the plant decreases in height every night, by an amount represented by `downSpeed`.

Since you grew the plant from a seed, it started at height `0` initially. Given an integer `desiredHeight`, your task is to find how many days it'll take for the plant to reach this height.

**Example**

For `upSpeed = 100`, `downSpeed = 10`, and `desiredHeight = 910`, the output should be
`growingPlant(upSpeed, downSpeed, desiredHeight) = 10`.

# 	Day 	Night
1 	100 	90
2 	190 	180
3 	280 	270
4 	370 	360
5 	460 	450
6 	550 	540
7 	640 	630
8 	730 	720
9 	820 	810
10 	910 	900

The plant first reaches a height of `910` on day `10`.
