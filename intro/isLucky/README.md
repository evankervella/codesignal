Ticket numbers usually consist of an even number of digits. A ticket number is considered _lucky_ if the sum of the first half of the digits is equal to the sum of the second half.

Given a ticket number `n`, determine if it's _lucky_ or not.


**Example**


* For `n = 1230`, the output should be `isLucky(n) = true`;

* For `n = 239017`, the output should be `isLucky(n) = false`.
