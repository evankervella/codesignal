In the popular **Minesweeper** game you have a board with some mines and those cells that don't contain a mine have a number in it that indicates the total number of mines in the neighboring cells. Starting off with some arrangement of mines we want to create a **Minesweeper** game setup.

**Example**

For

`matrix = [[true, false, false],
           [false, true, false],
           [false, false, false]]`

the output should be

`minesweeper(matrix) = [[1, 2, 1],
                        [2, 1, 1],
                        [1, 1, 1]]`
